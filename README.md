# custom firefox-sidebery-setup
My personal clean firefox + sidebery setup which maximizes screenspace without removing anything.

I really loved the look and feel of workspaces and the vertical tabs in Arc Browser but it was very restrictive. As I use a windows device primarily and I like to customize my experiences my go to browser is Firefox. Firefox nightly does have experimental vertical sidebars but it is not a full feature as of yet. I hope they implement a good one soon. This is my setup as of now. I'm very pleased with it.

## Addons used:

1. Sidebery - This addon adds vertical tabs, tab grouping and panels (basically workspaces). 

2. Firefox Color - Lets us customize the firefox theme extensively. 

3. Enable Picture-in-Picture (Optional-Bonus).

Warning: This is a realtively easy process but it does take a few steps and may need tinkering to work properly on your system. This works perfectly as of 12-12-2024 firefox version 133.0 on a 1080p screen. Do this at your own risk.

## Steps:

0. First of all go to settings and enable 'Open previous windows and tabs'.

### Setting Up UserChrome: This is necessary to modify the firefox UI and theme it to your liking. 

1. Open a new tab and go to about:config, click accept and continue. 

2. In the search bar type: toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets and set it to True.
